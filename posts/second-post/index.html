<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered why is math so abstract? In this article I want to dive deeper into this question and give 
you some examples to demonstrate what actually is abstraction in math.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-abstract">What is abstract??</h1>
<p>First let&rsquo;s make clear what we mean by word abstract. Abstract thing is something that only exist as a thought or an idea.
It isn&rsquo;t something that exist in real world. For example a line. In mathematics line is an infinitely long straight object or if we want to be a bit fancier instead of straight we can say one-dimensional.
Something like that definitely doesn&rsquo;t exist. It isn&rsquo;t tangible so how could it even be. It is infinite also which is a bit problematic too.
Surely we can imagine some connection between two points and imagine that somehow it continues forever, but that&rsquo;s exactly the abstractness of it. It&rsquo;s just an idea, not a real thing.
Of course that is just some basic example and as you&rsquo;re getting to higher level maths, everything becomes more and more abstract.</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>Often times common idea that comes to anyone&rsquo;s mind is that math is useless cause of the abstractness. Like if math only cares about abstract unreal ideas.
How is it relatable and useful to a real world problems? And sure it sounds logical. But&hellip; only if you don&rsquo;t think it deeper. Actually, it is quite the exact opposite.
If we would want math to be more real world relatable subject, it wouldn&rsquo;t be as useful as it is. Or you can say that it naturally becomes more and more abstract as people want it to be more and more useful.</p>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>So usefulness of math lies in its abstractness. But how? Everything I&rsquo;ve said so far is still very theoretical. So let&rsquo;s look at some more concrete examples.</p>
<h1 id="first-and-second-level-of-mathematical-abstraction">First and second level of mathematical abstraction</h1>
<p>In elementary school there are two really important abstraction levels that you need to achieve. But a lot of people doesn&rsquo;t realize
they are abstractions or even they need to think about them that way. First level comes right in the 1st grade or probably even earlier. Every children is taught that if you have four apples and 
you gain another two apples. You just have six apples. But same goes for example with age. When you&rsquo;re four years old, you know that two years later you will be six years old.
I&rsquo;m sure we would agree that &ldquo;apples&rdquo; and &ldquo;years&rdquo; are really different things/objects, no need to mention the differences. But when it comes to counting them, it&rsquo;s somehow the same concept. This is important.
When you realize this, number 3 and any other number doesn&rsquo;t describe anything real anymore. They are an abstract ideas describing quantity. So number 3 somehow describes any possible triplet you could imagine. Numbers can also represent other things, length for example. 
And this is called first level of mathematical abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="heading-2"></h2>
<p>Second level is a bit more interesting and much more important. It comes in 8th grade in our country. Numbers are well rooted in your head as an idea of count and you were learning how to manipulate them pretty much in school. This manipulation with numbers is called arithmetics.</p>
<h2 id="heading-3"></h2>
<p>Time has come to get to another level of abstraction&hellip; variables. Variables are abstraction of numbers same as numbers are abstraction of quantity. When we have some variable &ldquo;a&rdquo; for example. We think of it as it represents any number. But what&rsquo;s important to realize is that it actually isn&rsquo;t a number. Somehow all numbers are contained in that one variable, any possible number you can imagine. So if numbers are abstraction of quantity. variables are more like abstraction of count.</p>
<h2 id="heading-4"></h2>
<p>Theory of algebra was developed on that abstraction and I feel like a lot of people doesn&rsquo;t realize how algebra is actually really useful, because they never really understood variables and what they are representing. So the key to understand how useful it is&hellip; If we have some real world problem that can be abstracted/represented, described and solved using numbers. Then it can be represented using variables since variables are just abstraction of numbers. The problem with numbers is that even if you have basically the same type of problem. You need to solve it again everytime
cause the quantities/values have probably changed. Speed of car for example. Or maybe you can remember the way to solve it, but for more complicated hard to memorize problems you would probably reinvent the wheel everytime again. But there is a way to avoid this. As we said earlier variables somehow represents any number you could have. So if we were able to solve the problem represented by variables. Then the same solution applies to any values we start with. So we only need to solve one type of problem once and just plug in the values in the end. And that&rsquo;s exactly what algebra is about. Solving problems using variables, simplifying to the most simple solution.</p>
<h2 id="heading-5"></h2>
<p>That abstract solution that applies to any problem of the same type, all of that thanks to variables and algebra, is called general solution.
And generality is exactly what we&rsquo;re searching for in mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="heading-6"></h2>
<p>So that were some examples. You probably have some idea already, but let&rsquo;s talk about how abstraction and generality are connected.</p>
<h1 id="abstraction-as-a-way-to-generality">Abstraction as a way to generality</h1>
<p>The same thing as we used above is actually used commonly in higher mathematics. Finally it is time to define what abstraction is. So what we mean by abstraction in mathematics is looking at some different objects
and try to figure out something that they have in common. In other words to find some abstract connection between those objects. Now let&rsquo;s use that abstract connection and build a theory about it. For example algebra for variables or arithmetics for numbers.
And finally use that theory to find some facts about those objects which result only from those properties they have in common. This is why abstraction is so important. Not only that we can find general facts about some system of objects which are only related with our abstract connection.
But also it simplifies the problems cause we ignore all the concrete facts about these objects that are not important to us. Pretty cool, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<h2 id="heading-7"></h2>
<p>There are a lot of important abstractions and theories about them. For example graph theory that is a general way to describe relations or group theory that is a general way to describe symmetry. Or really important third level of mathematical abstraction, theory of vector spaces, which says that basically any object, and when I say any I mean literally any object, abstract or not, can be represented as some n-dimensional vector. Dimension depends on what type of object we want to represent. That&rsquo;s a little hint why mathematicians care about higher dimensions. It&rsquo;s not really about vectors themselves. It&rsquo;s about what they represent.
For example, did you know that modern translators are representing words as vectors using something called &ldquo;Word2vec algorithm&rdquo; made by czech computer-scientist Tomas Mikolov? Even translating can be abstracted using vector spaces and many more.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So I hope I have answered the question well enough. Despite the fact that abstraction is a basis of mathematics and there are tons of examples why it is true. They are pretty hard to explain since they are abstract of course. But I hope I somehow captured the main idea.
Thanks for reading. See you soon.</p>
